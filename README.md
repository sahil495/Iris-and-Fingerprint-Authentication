# This project was developed in three key phases:

# Dataset Preparation
Images for iris and fingerprint recognition were collected and organized into class-based folders. The original dataset had only 10 samples per class.

# Data Augmentation
To improve model performance, augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.) were applied to increase each class to 50 samples, ensuring better generalization.

# Model Training and Fusion
Separate CNN models were trained for iris and fingerprint data. Finally, a combined model was developed by fusing both features to enhance authentication accuracy.
